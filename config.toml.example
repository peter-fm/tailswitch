# TailSwitch Configuration
# Location: ~/.config/tailswitch/config.toml
#
# NOTE: You usually DON'T need this config file!
# TailSwitch automatically shows your existing tailscale profiles from `tailscale switch --list`
#
# Only create this config if you want to:
# 1. Add NEW tailnets that you haven't logged into yet
# 2. Use custom login servers (Headscale, etc.)
# 3. Use auth keys for automation

# Example: Adding a new tailnet (first time login)
# After logging in once, it will appear in your profiles list automatically
[[tailnets]]
name = "person@example.com"

# Example: Self-hosted Headscale server
[[tailnets]]
name = "headscale-network"
login_server = "https://headscale.example.com"

# Example: Automated login with auth key (no browser prompt)
[[tailnets]]
name = "automation-network"
login_server = "https://login.tailscale.com"
auth_key = "tskey-auth-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"

# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. TailSwitch shows ALL profiles from `tailscale switch --list` (with ★ for active)
# 2. If you select an existing profile → instant switch (no auth needed)
# 3. If you select a new tailnet from this config → browser opens for one-time login
# 4. After first login, the new profile is saved and future switches are instant
